# Triangle Devs Slack Code of Conduct

The Triangle Devs Slack is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, country of origin, age or religion.  We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.  

Community participants and admins violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the admin team.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

If you are being harassed, notice someone else is being harassed, or have other concerns, please [contact an admin](mailto:triangledevs-slack@googlegroups.com) immediately.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the admins retain the right to take any actions to keep events and online spaces as welcoming environments for all participants.  

Action may include warning the offender. Action could also include expelling the offender from meetings, events, and any online spaces this group uses on a temporary or permanent basis. A warning is not required to expel an offender.  

The admins will seek to use the least punitive means available to resolve an issue. If the circumstances require asking an offender to leave, we will do that.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our events and online spaces for everyone. We want you to be happy in our online space. People like you make them all better.

* Feel free to DM any of the admins at any time
* [Emailing the admin team](mailto:triangledevs-slack@googlegroups.com)

When taking a report, our staff will work to ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Investigations will remain as confidential as they can, but complete confidentially cannot be guaranteed. Due to the nature of investigations, some information may need to be shared within the organizing team but only on a need to know basis.

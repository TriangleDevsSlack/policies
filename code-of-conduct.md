# Triangle.rb Code of Conduct

Triangle.rb  is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.

Community participants and organizers violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizing team.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

If you are being harassed, notice someone else is being harassed, or have other
concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep events and online spaces as
welcoming environments for all participants.

Action may include warning the offender. Action could also include expelling the
offender from meetings, events, and any online spaces this group uses on a
temporary or permanent basis. A warning is not required to expel an offender.

The organizers will seek to use the least punitive means available to resolve an
issue. If the circumstances require asking an offender to leave, we will do
that.

These rules apply at all meetings, events, meeting or event-related social
activities (e.g. a meal or beer before or after the main event). These rules
also apply to the group's online spaces.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
value of our events and online spaces for everyone. We want you to be happy at
our meetings and events and participating in our online spaces. People like you
make them all better.

* Talking to the on-site organizers or organizers, who will introduce themselves
  at the beginning any event
* [Emailing the organizing team](mailto:trianglerb-organizers@googlegroups.com)

When taking a report in person, our staff will work to ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell
anyone who you are.

Investigations will remain as confidential as they can, but complete
confidentially cannot be guaranteed. Due to the nature of investigations, some
information may need to be shared within the organizing team but only on a need
to know basis.

Our team will be happy to help you contact local law enforcement, local support
services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration
of the event. We value your attendance.

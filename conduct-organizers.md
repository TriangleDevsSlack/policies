# Triangle.rb Code of Conduct - For Organizers

This version is intended for internal use by the group organizers.

## Warnings

Any organizers can issue a verbal warning to a participant that
their behavior violates the group's anti-harassment policy. Warnings should
be reported to the [organizers team](mailto:trianglerb-organizers@googlegroups.com)
as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

## Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or
minor problems, although an organizer should speak to the presenter afterward.

However, organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any
presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment
policy. Sexualized content (text or imagery) is grounds to immediately halt a
presentation. Personal attacks would be another.

Simply say, "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued, it
is in violation of our Code of Conduct." with no further explanation.

## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what
they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making
specific promises about what actions the organizers will take.

Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as
time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even
if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking
the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the
appropriate organizer(s).

If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by organizers, venue staff
or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not
pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect
the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others,
especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff
members.

## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed
entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some
general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A [first/second/third/seventeenth] offense resulting in a warning from
  organizers
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
* Venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

## Public statements

As a general rule, organizers should not make any public statements about
the behavior of individual people during or after events.

In general, consult with other organizers when possible but act when necessary.

# TriangleDevs Slack Channel Code of Conduct - For Admins

This version is intended for internal use by the slack admins.

## Warnings

Any admin can issue a verbal warning to a participant if their behavior violates the group's anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to the [admin team](mailto:triangledevs-slack@googlegroups.com) as soon as practical. The report should include: 

* Identifying information of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take.  

Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, channel, screenshot) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate admins.  

## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any members of the slack admins team for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled: 

* A [first/second/third/seventeenth] offense resulting in a warning from
  organizers
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense 
* A single obviously intentional offense

## Public statements

As a general rule, organizers should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after events.

In general, consult with other organizers when possible but act when necessary.

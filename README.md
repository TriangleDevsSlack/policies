## High-level code of conduct

Triangle.rb is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.

Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the community at the discretion of the organizers.

Our anti-harassment policy can be found [here][conduct]

## Updates

Policy changes are generally made by one of the Triangle.rb organizers,
listed above but PR submissions from the community are welcome.

All changes should be made by creating a new branch, making the desired changes,
then opening a pull request for feedback. Please tag one of the organizers for
a review.
